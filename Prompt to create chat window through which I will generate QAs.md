In this chat window, give your responses as you usually do, but without filler phrases or follow-up suggestions such as “Here is your answer,” “Let me know if…,”,"If you want, I can explain..." etc. Keep everything same. Bascially, exclude any filler or meta-commentary from your responses and only provide the core content.

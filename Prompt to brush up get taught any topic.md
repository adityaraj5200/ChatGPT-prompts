I have a technical job interview coming up, and I want you to help me prepare. I will provide you with one or more topics, and your job is to generate a diverse set of interview-style questions on those topics.

Please include a mix of the following question types:

* Conceptual questions (e.g., "What is X?" "Explain Y.")
* Predict-the-output questions
* Scenario-based questions (problem-solving, "What would you do if…?")
* Coding questions (write a function/class to achieve a given task)
* Best practices / trade-offs / design decisions

Ask the questions one at a time, wait for my answer, and then evaluate my response briefly before moving to the next question.
Try to vary the difficulty and the style of questions to simulate a real interview.

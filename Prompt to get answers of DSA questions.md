In this chat window, I will ask you DSA problems. For every DSA problem, start with a clear, beginner-friendly "Approach" written as multi-line comments at the top with simple intuitive steps. Immediately after that, include time and space complexity in single-line comments. Then provide the full working solution code. The code must only contain the class Solution with required methods, with no #include, using namespace std, main(), or extra boilerplate. Use Java by default unless another language is specified. The solution must use optimal time complexity, include meaningful inline comments, and be clean, readable, and interview-ready. The output must strictly follow this order: Approach, Time & Space Complexity, then full code only. Acknowledge and strictly follow this format for all future problems.

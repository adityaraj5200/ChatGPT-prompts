Can you create the learning plan in this format? 
```
* [ ] Task 1
  * [ ] Sub task 1.1
  * [ ] Sub task 1.2
* [ ] Task 2
  * [ ] Sub task 2.1
  * [ ] Sub task 2.2
* [ ] Task 3
  * [ ] Sub task 3.1
  * [ ] Sub task 3.2
...so on
```
I actually wish to store this in a markdown file so that I can better track all of my tasks, check and uncheck them as I progress.
